# Implementation for CS440 Project Side Channel Timing Attack

Created on: 26 August 2025

Ideas:
1. Password Comparison Attack
2. Hashing Side Channel
3. Web Timing Attack on Different Endpoints

## Implementation instructions for POC
1. Create a python virtual environment - Unless you don't mind messing up your local filesystem with varying package versions. Plus I installed a bunch of random packages to make things work, especially with the frontend display since i especially suck at (and also dont understand) react/jsx, and didnt clean up
2. Check it's using your virtual env python with `which python` and it should point to the virtual environment bin/python
2. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` -> Please dont pipx, that's a system wide installation
